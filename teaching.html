				<h3>VV557 Methods of Applied Mathematics II (2015 Spring)</h3>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p align="justify">
					This course discusses Green’s function methods for solving PDEs, focusing on the Laplace equation but also extending to other PDEs. Starting from the Dirac delta function as a formal symbol to denote a point source, we begin a discussion of generalized functions (distributions), including weal derivatives and the distributional Fourier transform, leading to weak (distributional) solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations. Basic concepts are introduced and various methods for finding Green’s functions are discussed, including conformal mappings, the method of images and eigenfunction expansions. As an application, we give a brief overview of the use of Green’s functions in the boundary element method.
				</p>
				<h4>Topic</h4>
				<p>Green’s function; distributions; generalized solution to PDE.</p>			
			
				<h3>VE301 Probabilistic Methods in Engineering (2015 Spring)</h3>
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p align="justify">
					This course on basic elements of statistical and probabilistic methods focuses particularly on applications to engineering such as quality control, acceptance sampling and comparison of qualitative data. The goal is to introduce the student to statistical methods and give enough practice and familiarity so that these methods may be immediately applied in other courses, lab experiments and project work.
				</p>
				<h4>Topic</h4>
				<p>Probability theory; statistical inference; basic random process.</p>
